Almost a year ago, I wrote my first blog post on Medium about the highly public Lee family feud. Well, it wasn't actually about the feud itself. I was just writing about how one could download comments from a Facebook post using their Graph API, and then perform some sentiment analysis with the Google Cloud Natural Language API.

Nevertheless, it was a popular topic and some local media outlets covered my blog post almost as if it was a commentary on the government's approval rating.

"Many Singaporeans have something to say about the recent public feud involving Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his siblings, Lee Wei Ling and Lee Hsien Yang. While some netizens have posted words of encouragement and support on PM Lee&#039;s Facebook page, there has also been a fair share of detractors. But what is the overall sentiment of Singaporeans in the wake of this family matter that has been made very public recently?"
