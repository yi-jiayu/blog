A long time ago, I wrote a [series][1] [of][2] [posts][3] about the [Telegram Bot API][8] on Medium.
It walked readers through the process of creating an [inline Telegram bot][4] running on [Google
Cloud Functions][5] which served Pokédex data from a [JSON document][6] on the [Pokémon website][7].

That was the original Rotom Pokédex bot.
